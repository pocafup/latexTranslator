\section*{Jacobian}

Consider the function \( F : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \), where

\[
F = (F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_m)
\]

\section*{Directional Derivative (Geometry)}

For a function \( u(x, y) \), the directional derivative in the direction of a vector \(\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2)\) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u_1 + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} u_2
\end{equation}

This represents the rate of change of the function \( u \) in the direction of the vector \(\mathbf{u}\).
