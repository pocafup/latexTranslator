\section*{Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)}

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation involving a function and its derivatives. For example, consider the equation:

\begin{equation}
f'(x) = \sin f(x)
\end{equation}

This is an ODE.

\section*{Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)}

A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that contains unknown functions and their partial derivatives. For example, a first-order PDE can be written as:

\begin{equation}
E(x, y, u(x, y), u_x(x, y), u_y(x, y)) = 0
\end{equation}

where \( u(x, y) \) is a function of two variables \( x \) and \( y \), and \( u_x \) and \( u_y \) are the partial derivatives of \( u \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.

Another way to express a PDE is:

\begin{equation}
F(x, y, u, u_x, u_y) = 0
\end{equation}
