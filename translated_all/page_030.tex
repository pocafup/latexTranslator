\section*{Potential Energy and Mechanical Energy Conservation}

The potential energy is denoted by \( U \). Then the total energy, which is the sum of kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE), is given by:

\[
\text{Total Energy} = \text{KE} + \text{PE} = 0
\]

This defines the mechanical energy to be:

\[
\text{Mechanical Energy} = \text{KE} + \text{PE}
\]

Thus, we have the mechanical energy conservation equation:

\[
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = 0
\]

with boundary conditions:

\[
u(0) = q(x) = b
\]

and

\[
U(x, 0) = 0
\]

The energy equation can be expressed as:

\[
E = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} y u p + \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} \right) \, dx
\]
```
