\section*{Proof}

What if at some point in the interior of $\mathbb{R}$ that reaches the maximum value of $U(x, y)$, then $(x_0, y_0)$ satisfies $U_x(x_0, y_0) = 0$.

The Hessian matrix is given by:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
U_{xx} & U_{xy} \\
U_{xy} & U_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

For a maximum, the Hessian must be negative definite, which is equivalent to:

\[
U_{xx} < 0 \quad \text{and} \quad U_{xx}U_{yy} - U_{xy}^2 > 0
\]

At $(x_0, y_0)$, we have:

\[
U_{xx}U_{yy} - U_{xy}^2 > 0
\]

Let $v(x, t) = u(x, t) + 2x^2$. Then:

\[
u_x = R U_x = R U_{xx} - 2kE
\]

And:

\[
U_{xx} + 2k
\]

This leads to a contradiction if $U(x_0, y_0) \neq 0$.
