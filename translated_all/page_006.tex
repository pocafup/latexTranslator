\section*{Solutions to Linear Equations}

Consider the linear equations:

\begin{align}
    Lu &= f(x), \\
    Ax &= b.
\end{align}

For the homogeneous case, we have:

\begin{align}
    Qu &= 0, \\
    Ax &= 0.
\end{align}

The general solution can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
    U &= U_g + U_s, \\
    X &= X_g + X_s,
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U_g$ is a general solution of $Lu = 0$,
    \item $U_s$ is a special solution,
    \item $X_g$ is a general solution of $Ax = 0$,
    \item $X_s$ is a special solution of $Ax = b$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Proposition}

Let $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ be solutions of $Lu = 0$. Then the linear combination

\begin{equation}
    u(t) = c_1 U_1 + c_2 U_2 + \cdots + c_n U_n
\end{equation}

is also a solution of $Lu = 0$, where $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ are constants.
