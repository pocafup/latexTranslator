\section*{Uniqueness Theorem for Wave Equation}

Consider the wave equation:

\begin{equation}
    U_{tt} - c^2 U_{xx} = 0
\end{equation}

with initial conditions:

\begin{align}
    u(x, 0) &= 0, \\
    u_t(x, 0) &= 0.
\end{align}

We define the energy function \( E(t) \) as:

\begin{equation}
    E(t) = \int \left( U_t^2 + c^2 U_x^2 \right) \, dx
\end{equation}

At \( t = 0 \), the energy is:

\begin{equation}
    E(0) = 0
\end{equation}

Since the energy \( E(t) \) is constant over time, we have:

\begin{equation}
    E(t) = \text{const} = 0
\end{equation}

Thus, \( U_t = 0 \) and \( U_x = 0 \), implying that the solution is unique and zero everywhere.
