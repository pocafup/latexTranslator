\section*{Example 4}

Consider the partial differential equation:
\[
U_x + 2x U_y = 0.
\]

\subsection*{Solution}

We start by considering the characteristic equations:
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2x}{1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = x^2 + C.
\]

Thus, the general solution can be expressed as:
\[
u(x, y) = f(y - x^2),
\]
where \( f \) is an arbitrary function.

Given the initial condition \( u(0, -5) = 0 \), we substitute into the general solution:
\[
u(0, -5) = f(-5 - 0^2) = f(-5) = 0.
\]

Therefore, the specific solution satisfying the initial condition is:
\[
u(x, y) = f(y - x^2),
\]
where \( f(-5) = 0 \).

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The solution to the partial differential equation is determined by the function \( f \) which satisfies the initial condition. The characteristic curves are given by \( y = x^2 + C \), and the solution is constant along these curves.
